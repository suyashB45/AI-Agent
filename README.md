# AI-Agent
An AI Agent is a software-based system designed to perform tasks autonomously or with minimal human intervention. It operates based on algorithms, data, and a defined environment to perceive, analyze, and act upon given objectives. AI agents can learn from their interactions, adapt to changes, and make informed decisions to achieve their goals.
