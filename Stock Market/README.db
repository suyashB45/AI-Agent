# AI Agent Playground - Stock Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates an interactive AI agent that can fetch and analyze stock data using Yahoo Finance, providing insights such as stock price, analyst recommendations, and fundamentals. The agent uses the **Groq model** (LLama-3.3-70b-versatile) for natural language processing tasks and responds to user queries in a command-line interface.

## Key Features

- **Stock Analysis**: Fetches data about stock prices, analyst recommendations, and financial fundamentals.
- **Dynamic Symbol Handling**: Detects stock symbols from queries and processes any valid symbol.
- **Command-Line Interface**: A text-based interaction where users can enter queries, and the agent responds with the relevant data.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `pip` for managing Python dependencies
- **.env** file for environment variables (if applicable)

### Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may need to install the following libraries (if they are not in your `requirements.txt` file):

- `phi`: For the AI model.
- `yfinance`: For stock data fetching.
- `dotenv`: For managing environment variables.

To create a `requirements.txt` for this project, you can use the following content:

```txt
phi
yfinance
python-dotenv
```

### Configuration

1. **Set up the `.env` file**: This file should contain any necessary environment variables. Make sure it is located in the root of the project directory.

   Example `.env`:

   ```ini
   # Example .env file
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Model Initialization**: The Groq model used here is `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. Ensure that you have access to the Groq model API.

## Usage

### Running the Program

To run the program, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python agent_playground.py
```

### Command-Line Interaction

- After starting the program, you will be prompted to enter a query.
- Example query: `'Summarize and compare analyst recommendations and fundamentals for TSLA and AAPL.'`
- The agent will process the query and return a response.
- Type `'exit'` to quit the program.

### Example Queries

- "Compare stock fundamentals for TSLA and AAPL."
- "What are the latest analyst recommendations for MSFT?"
- "Show me the stock price for GOOGL."

### Sample Output

```txt
Enter your query (or type 'exit' to quit): Summarize and compare analyst recommendations and fundamentals for TSLA and AAPL.
Response:
| Stock Symbol | Analyst Recommendations | Price | Market Cap | PE Ratio |
|--------------|-------------------------|-------|------------|----------|
| TSLA         | Buy                     | 650   | 700B       | 120      |
| AAPL         | Hold                    | 145   | 2.5T       | 35       |

Enter your query (or type 'exit' to quit): exit
Exiting the AI Agent Playground.
